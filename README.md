This repo contains the samples that demonstrate Angular (v4x) for the purposes of devilering 'training modules excersices' to the United States military branches. These code samples were created with the Angular v4 and Bootstrap v4 templates.

> **Note:** If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, you can download the entire collection as a 
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/185SE14THST/ng-military-psych-training-readiness/archive/master.zip), but be 
> sure to unzip everything to access shared dependencies. 

## Using the sample

You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in Visual Studio Code. Node JS is also required prior to using this sample.
